        paragraphs={[
          "The hospitality industry is more subject to seasonal changes than ever before, compared to any other sphere of activity.",
          "Most of our clients during the first quarter cannot accurately predict the number and need for external or foreign workers during the high season.",
          "It is obvious that the situation in which most resorts, hotels and restaurants make last-minute hiring decisions results in a sudden increase in demand for workers. This further results in the marketâ€™s unwillingness to meet that demand immediately. Namely, from the moment of signing the contract with the Employment Agency, it takes a month or even two until the foreign workers arrive at their workplace. Finding workers, testing qualifications, interviewing, paperwork and similar processes take up most of that time.",

This service provides a practical solution for urgent manpower needs, providing flexibility and efficiency in managing workers for different projects and seasonal requirements."
